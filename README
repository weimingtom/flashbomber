How to get started:

1) Download and install Flex3 SDK
2) Download and install Erlang SDK
3) Add Erlang bin directory to your shell path
4) Copy the file flash/local.build.properties_template to flash/local.build.properties (Don't add it to version control, please)
5) Fix the paths in the local.build.properties so that they point to your Flex installation directory as well as the dir you checked out the project to

You can also change the executable to run the flash client in. By default it will be Firefox in a windows installation.
