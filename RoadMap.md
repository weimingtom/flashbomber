## Current Status ##

The project is currently in very initial phase. We are designing and building the basic structure for the client and server applications.

## version 1.0 ##

The first playable version of the game should be ready on Q2/2009.

It will contain the following features:

  * One arena (the most basic one with no special tiles)
  * Multiplayer support

## version 2.0 ##

This version is just to have a placeholder for all the features that can not be added to the version 1.

You can consider this the "wishlist".
